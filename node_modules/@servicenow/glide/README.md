### How to build on Jenkins
* Create a `pom.xml` file at the root level
* Go to the [BT1 Service Catalog](https://buildtools1.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fcom.glideapp.servicecatalog_cat_item_view.do%3Fv%3D1%26sysparm_id%3D9dbd0c54db1acb403a3d5dd5ce961948%26sysparm_link_parent%3Dad2fecb72bfc310052f7c71317da157e%26sysparm_catalog%3De0d08b13c3330100c8b837659bba8fb4%26sysparm_catalog_view%3Dess%26sysparm_view%3Dess) to request a Jenkins job

Once the request is processed, a multi-branch job is created on https://buildmaster-hotel.devsnc.com and will build any branches that match [ServiceNow branch naming convention](https://buildtools1.service-now.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB0528607).

### Package Naming Conventions

- Any java API exposed in Glide will be exposed in @servicenow/glide
- This repo will depend on sub repos which will contain more granular packages 
    - Ex: @servicenow/glide-record, @servicenow/glide-date-time, etc
- A Fluent project can choose to depend on either the more mono package or granular packages
    - Reasons for allowing both
        - A large package is easier to code against
        - Smaller packages are quicker for module resolution on instance
- Each namespaced API can be a separate sub-package
    - Ex: import { AppStoreAPI} from @servicenow/sn_appstore_api 
- And a separate folder in glide
    - Ex: import { AppStoreAPI} from @servicenow/glide/sn_appstore_api
- Any OOB Java API (not in Glide) will be exposed by namespace @servicenow/namespace
     - Ex: import { CartJS } from @servicenow/sn_sc
